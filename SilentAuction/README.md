<h1 align="center">Silent Auction</h1>

I was tasked to create a Silent Auction in my class, "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022" by Dr. Angela Wu. I am taking this Udemy class on the side of my official coursework at Western Governors University. This is day nine of the class.

<h2>I was to focus on using the following concepts that I learned today.</h2>

-Dictionaries

-Nested list and dictionaries within dictionaries

-Looping through dictionaries

<h2>What I learned</h2>
I learned how to use a clear function based on which os a user is running. The main focus was to understand dictionary syntax and how to retrieve the keys or values stored for use. It seemed like a fairly small step.

<h2>Issues I had and where I can do better.</h2>
I have been having issues lately with properly using for loops and while loops. It is having a bit of trouble sticking in my mind. Maybe it was difficult today because of using the new dicitonary syntax to loop through. I think I just need more practice with it.
